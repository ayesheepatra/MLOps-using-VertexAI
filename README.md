Project: Automated TFX Pipeline Deployment for Forest Cover Prediction
Objective: Deployed and ran a TensorFlow Extended (TFX) pipeline on Google Cloud to automate the development and deployment of a TensorFlow 2.3 WideDeep Classifier for predicting forest cover from cartographic data.

Tools and Technologies:

TFX CLI: Utilized the TFX CLI utility to build and deploy the TFX pipeline.
AI Platform Pipelines (Kubeflow Pipelines): Employed a hosted instance for orchestrating the TFX pipeline.
Dataflow: Managed scalable and distributed data processing for various TFX components.
AI Platform Training: Conducted model training and managed parallel tuning trials.
AI Platform Prediction: Deployed blessed pipeline model versions to AI Platform Prediction for serving.
CloudTuner and AI Platform Vizier: Implemented advanced model hyperparameter tuning using the Vizier algorithm for optimizing model performance.
Key Achievements:

Automated the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment.
Improved model accuracy and efficiency through advanced hyperparameter tuning.
Leveraged scalable cloud infrastructure to handle large datasets and complex model training processes.
Ensured robust and reliable model serving using AI Platform Prediction.
Impact: Enhanced the predictive capabilities for forest cover classification, leading to more accurate and efficient analysis of cartographic data for environmental monitoring and management.
